"""Shared dark-theme styling for every Exploring Radio schematic.

The site uses the Material "slate" (dark) theme. schemdraw's defaults render
black-on-white, which looks broken against a dark page. Build EVERY schematic
through ``dark_drawing()`` so the whole site stays visually consistent and no
diagram ever ships with the wrong colours.

This is the single file a future tool migration would need to re-implement —
keep all colour/weight decisions here, never inline them in individual circuit
scripts.
